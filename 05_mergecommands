Defination of Merge :
Merge means combining changes from one branch or file into another so they become one updated version.


# merge commands are follows :-
git status 
=> Shows which files have been changed and whether they are staged or not.
git branch 
=> it shows the present branch or others branch
git checkout main 
=> switched to main branch
git pull origin main 
=> it helps to retrive latest code from github and updating the local main
git merge feature-branch
=> this commands helps to merge feature-branch code into main and merge them
git push origin main 
=> it upload merge code into github repo

conflict solve:
git add .
=> it checkes the conflict fix file stage 
git commit 
=> complete merge and save

#conflict :-
Conflict happens when Git cannot automatically merge changes because the same part of a file was changed
in different ways in two branches.
