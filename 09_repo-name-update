:>
sometimes you dont like your own repo name and change it but then you're already added files and folders in in repo so hou you can
update the repo name in old ternimal (repo ko name change gariyo github ma then vs code ko terminal mata change gareko name aaudaina purano name nai hunxa 
tellai hamile chai git commands used garera update garna sakinxa)

so the commands are as follows:
(1)check current remote :>
git remote -v
youwill see old URl like for eg :https://github.com/username/oldfileurl.git
(2) Update Remote URL to new Repo
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/filename.git (update in filename to your new URL of the repo)
(3) confirm 
git remote -v
(4) git push -u origin main / master
